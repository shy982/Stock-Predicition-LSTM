# Stock-Predicition-LSTM
This project gives an LSTM based implementation of a stock prediction model where the closing price of stocks are read from a csv file and are trained with suitable hyper-parameters
The final_stock_pred.py file contains the pre trained NN which was run for 50-60 epochs due to the ack of a GPU in my current PC
# Scraper
Basic use of Beautiful Soup library in python to scrape the necessary closing price and trend of stock from nasdaq website is given for interest of the reader and should be used(with or w/o modifying)at his/her own risk only
# Optimization
For hyper-parameter optimizations a seperate code is provided for the interest of the reader. Further material on this optimizer can be found from appropriate literature.
